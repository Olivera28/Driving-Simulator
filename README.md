# DK Team
Senior Design Project

This project will focus on creating a steering wheel box to control a
RC car by using Arduino microcontrollers, 2 FPV cameras, a camera transmitter and a receiver, 2 BLDC motors and 1 stepper motor, etc.

The first steps for our team is to demonstrate how to control the RC car manually from a remote computer. The Arduino Demo_Control file is the main key for the objetive.
