# DK Team
Senior Design Project

Team DK is working on a project that we believe can help new drivers and reduce car accidents. Our project is a live driving simulator that uses a steering wheel and two pedals (Acceleration and Brake pedals) to control an RC car. The driving simulator system can communicate through WiFi within the range of a WiFi network. The system is designed as a platform for new drivers to practice and hone their driving skills, as well as for entertainment purposes. It acts as an intermediate training ground providing experiences very similar to driving in the real world. The technologies implemented in the system are a force feedback steering control that provides a real steering wheel feel, data mapping to correctly communicate the acceleration to the two brushless DC motors in the RC car, data interface to simulate a dashboard and remind users of their driving speed, and gear control by using three push buttons. These push buttons will simulate the change in the gears of a real car. Users can experience driving a real car using the driving simulator by navigating through an obstacle course.
